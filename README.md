# Predictive Maintenance and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation for Fixed Plant Assets

This project focuses on developing predictive maintenance models to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of fixed plant assets, such as machinery and equipment used in mining operations. The goal is to prevent unexpected failures, optimise maintenance schedules, and reduce downtime, ultimately improving operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
